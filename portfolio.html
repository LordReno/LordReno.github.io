                            to a simulated natural disaster scenario. The challenge involved completing a range of tasks

                            earn Bones. Players can unlock and trade a variety of rare and unique dog skins. I worked as
                            the sole programmer on a collaborative team, developing all game systems including core
                            mechanics, multiplayer functionality, store features, and the skin trading system.

                            implemented a dynamic procedural generation system that ensures the course never repeats and
                            scales in difficulty based on player performance. The game encourages friendly competition,
